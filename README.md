## üîß Setup


To see and run the code with the correct packages installed, please clone the GitHub repository to a place on your computer where you'd like to have it by typing:

#### MAC / WORKER02

```
git clone https://github.com/marmor97/cds-visual-exam # Clone repository to local machine or server

cd cds-visual-exam # Change directory to the repository folder

bash create_vision_venv.sh # Creates a virtual environment
```

#### WINDOWS

```
git clone https://github.com/marmor97/cds-visual-exam # Clone repository to local machine or server

cd cds-visual-exam # Change directory to the repository folder

bash ./create_vision_venv_win.sh
```


Every time you wish to run any of the scripts, please type the following commands:

```
source cv101_marie/bin/activate # Activates virtual environment
```

Now you can move to any script in the src folder and execute it:

```

cd src/{insert assignment number} # Changing to src and assignment folder 

python3 {insert script name} # Run script
```

bash kill_vision_venv.sh

```
